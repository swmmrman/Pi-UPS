# Raspberry PI UPS EP-0118 Monitor

This is a basic monitor built around the 52Pi UPS Module for RaspberryPi.  Currently this has only been tested on a RaspberryPi4 8GB, running Manjaro Linux.  This will cover setting up the RTC and Coulometer.\ 
As most guides do not cover getting i2c enabled, those steps will be included here as well.  You may not need these steps in other operating systems.

## Requirements
### In progress
* A 52Pi EP-0118
* A RaspberryPi 4
* Python3
